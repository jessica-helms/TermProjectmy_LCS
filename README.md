# TermProjectmy_LCS
To use the codes, you can save it as a .py and type in: python myLCS_DP.py to use dynamic progamming and show an intermediate table 
or you can use myLCS_Re.py to use a recursive function (this is slower)
you can use these to randomly generate DNA sequences to find the longest common subsequence. 
to find the LCS of specific sequences simply type them after. For example: python myLCS_DP.py ACTGA CATGA
you can also randomly generate sequences of a certain length. For example, if you want them to be 7 nucleotides long, type: python myLCS_DP.py 7
